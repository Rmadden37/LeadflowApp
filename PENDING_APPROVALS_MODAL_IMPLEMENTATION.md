## üé® **WHAT WAS BUILT**

  - Role selection dropdown for each user
  - Approve/Deny buttons with proper styling
  - Real-time count display on trigger button

### **Integration Points**

   - Added modal trigger button next to "Invite New User" button

## üîß **TECHNICAL FEATURES**

### **Modal Interface**
```tsx
<PendingApprovalsModal 
  triggerClassName="custom-styling-classes"
  triggerVariant="outline" | "default" | "secondary" 
  triggerSize="sm" | "default" | "lg"
/>
```

### **Key Functionality**
- **Permission-Based Access:** Only managers and admins can see the modal
- **Team Filtering:** Managers see only their team's approvals, admins see all
- **Role Assignment:** Dropdown to select role (setter, closer, manager*, admin*)
  - *Manager/Admin roles only available to admins
- **Real-time Updates:** Uses Firestore `onSnapshot()` for live data
- **Batch Operations:** Uses `writeBatch()` for atomic approve/reject operations

### **Database Operations**
- **Approval Process:**
  - Updates user status to "active"
  - Assigns selected role
  - Preserves team assignment (critical bug fix included)
  - Creates closer record if role is closer/manager/admin
  - Updates pending approval status
- **Rejection Process:**
  - Updates user status to "rejected"
  - Records rejection details with timestamp
