## 🎯 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Desktop Testing (Completed)**
```bash
# Access performance test page
open http://localhost:9002/performance-test
```

### **2. Mobile Device Testing**
For optimal testing on actual iOS devices:

#### **Find Your Local IP:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

#### **Access on iOS Safari:**
- Open iOS Safari browser
- Navigate to: `http://[YOUR_IP]:9002/performance-test`
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100:9002/performance-test`

#### **What to Test:**
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling through 50 lead cards
- [ ] Instant touch responses (no 300ms delay)
- [ ] Fluid swipe gestures on lead cards
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Performance metrics overlay
- [ ] Memory stability during extended use
- [ ] Battery impact assessment
