## 🔍 What's Being Deployed

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Memory Configuration:** 2 CPU cores with 4GiB RAM
- **Build Performance:** CI-optimized build bypassing TypeScript/ESLint
- **Authentication:** 3-second timeout with persistence
- **Loading Performance:** Target <3 seconds initial load
- **Component Loading:** Selective dynamic imports instead of excessive lazy loading

### Key Features:
- Enhanced error boundaries with graceful error handling
- Progressive loading with debug information
- Emergency navigation fallbacks
- Fast avatar caching system
- Optimized CSS for loading states

## 📋 Next Steps (When Live)

1. **Health Check Validation**
   ```bash
   curl -s -f https://leadflow-app--leadflow-app-436022.web.app
   ```

2. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   ./test-loading-performance.js
   ```

3. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test login flow
   - Verify Firebase Auth integration
   - Check real-time features

4. **Cloud Run Metrics**
   - Verify memory usage stays within 4GiB limit
   - Monitor CPU utilization with 2-core allocation
   - Check cold start performance

## 🚨 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
firebase apphosting:backends:list --project=leadflow-app-436022

# Test site accessibility
curl -s -I https://leadflow-app--leadflow-app-436022.web.app

# Run performance tests
./test-loading-performance.js

# Monitor with automatic refresh
./monitor-deployment.sh
```

## 📞 Expected Results

When deployment completes successfully:
- ✅ Main page loads in <3 seconds
- ✅ Authentication works with 3-second timeout
- ✅ No memory allocation errors in Cloud Run
- ✅ Emergency fallbacks provide good UX during any loading delays
- ✅ Real-time features (chat, lead updates) function properly
