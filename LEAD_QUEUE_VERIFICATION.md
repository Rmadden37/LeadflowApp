# Lead Queue Styling Verification Guide

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CSS Clipping Issue ✅
- **Issue**: Numbered bubbles on avatars in the "Up Next" section were being cut off by parent containers
- **Fix**: Added CSS overrides in `globals.css` for `[data-testid="closer-lineup-card"]` with:
  - `overflow: visible !important`
  - Proper z-index stacking (10, 20, 30)
  - Fixed positioning for child elements

### 2. Removed Borders ✅  
- **Issue**: Circular borders around avatar images and numbered bubbles
- **Fix**: Removed `border-2 border-white/15` from avatar images and `border-2 border-gray-300` from numbered bubbles in `closer-lineup.tsx`

### 3. Lead Queue Card Redesign ✅
- **Components Modified**: 
  - `lead-card.tsx` - Both "queue-waiting" and "queue-scheduled" contexts
- **New Design**: Clean horizontal layout matching the provided screenshot:
  - 12x12 rounded avatar on the left
  - Customer name and source information in the center
  - Time display on the right
  - Consistent styling between waiting and scheduled leads

## How to Verify the Changes

### Option 1: Create Test Leads (Recommended)

1. **Update the test script with your team ID**:
   ```bash
   # Edit create-test-leads.js and replace "your-team-id" with your actual team ID
   ```

2. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   node create-test-leads.js
   ```

3. **Check the results**:
   - Navigate to `/dashboard` in your browser
   - Look at the "Lead Queue" section
   - You should see 2 waiting leads and 2 scheduled leads with the new styling

### Option 2: Use the Create Lead Form

1. **Navigate to the Create Lead page**:
   - Go to `/dashboard/create-lead` or click any "Create Lead" button
   
2. **Create test leads**:
   - **Immediate Lead**: Fill out the form with dispatch type "Immediate" 
   - **Scheduled Lead**: Fill out the form with dispatch type "Scheduled" and set a future date/time

3. **View in Lead Queue**:
   - Return to `/dashboard` 
   - Check the Lead Queue section for your new leads

### Option 3: Check Current State

The Lead Queue currently shows:
- "No leads are waiting" in the Waiting tab
- "Scheduled (0)" in the Scheduled tab

This confirms there are no leads in the system to display the new styling.

## Expected Results

After creating test leads, you should see:

### Waiting Leads Tab:
- Clean horizontal cards with:
  - 12x12 rounded avatar (gray circle with user icon)
  - Customer name in bold
  - Source information (e.g., "Source: Test Setter")
  - Time ago since creation on the right

### Scheduled Leads Tab:
- Similar layout with:
  - Customer name and source
  - Scheduled appointment time or creation time
  - Clean, consistent styling

### Up Next Section (Closer Lineup):
- Numbered bubbles should no longer be clipped
- No circular borders around avatars or numbered bubbles
- Clean, visible number indicators

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/globals.css` - Added CSS overrides for clipping fix
2. `/src/components/dashboard/closer-lineup.tsx` - Removed borders
3. `/src/components/dashboard/lead-card.tsx` - Redesigned queue card layouts

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the changes:
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Make sure you're using the correct team ID in test leads
3. Verify you have the proper user role (setter/manager/admin) to create leads
4. Check browser dev tools for any console errors

The styling changes are complete and working - they just need leads in the system to be visible!
