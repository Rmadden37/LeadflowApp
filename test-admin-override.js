🔍 ADMIN OVERRIDE TEST INSTRUCTIONS

The admin override functionality is already implemented! Here's how to test it:

1. **Login as Admin/Manager** - Use an account with admin or manager role
2. **Navigate to Dashboard** - Go to the main dashboard
3. **Look for "Active Assignments" section** - Admins see this instead of "In Process Leads"
4. **Find a lead with status "waiting_assignment"** - These should show Accept buttons
5. **Click "Accept & Start"** - This should work without permission errors

## What should happen:
✅ Admin can see Accept & Start buttons on waiting_assignment leads
✅ Admin can see Accept Job buttons on scheduled leads  
✅ Clicking these buttons calls the acceptJob cloud function successfully
✅ Lead status changes to "accepted" or "in_process" 
✅ Activity log shows admin as accepter, closer as assignee

## If it's still not working, check:
1. **User Role** - Ensure you're logged in as admin/manager
2. **Team Assignment** - Admin can only accept jobs for their team
3. **Lead Status** - Only waiting_assignment and scheduled leads show buttons
4. **Browser Console** - Look for any JavaScript errors

## Permission Matrix:
- Admin: Can accept ANY lead in their team ✅
- Manager: Can accept leads in their team ✅  
- Closer: Can only accept their assigned leads ✅

## Testing Commands (run in browser console):
\`\`\`javascript
// Check your user role
console.log('User role:', window.user?.role);

// Check team ID  
console.log('Team ID:', window.user?.teamId);

// Test the acceptJob function directly
window.acceptJobFunction({ leadId: 'your-lead-id-here' })
  .then(result => console.log('✅ Success:', result))
  .catch(error => console.error('❌ Error:', error));
\`\`\`

The fix is already deployed and active! 🎉
