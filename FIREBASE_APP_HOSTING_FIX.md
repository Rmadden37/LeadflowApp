# Firebase App Hosting Fix Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes implemented to resolve the Firebase App Hosting deployment issues.

## Problem Analysis

The Firebase App Hosting deployment was failing because:

1. **Configuration Mismatch**: The Next.js configuration was set for static export but App Hosting requires server-side rendering capabilities.
2. **Build Directory Issue**: Firebase was looking for files in the `dist` directory but the server-side build outputs to the `.next` directory.
3. **API Route Bug**: The leaderboard data API route had a variable reference error.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Next.js Configuration Updates

We modified `next.config.js` to:
- Use `.next` as the build output directory
- Remove the static export configuration
- Set environment variables to indicate App Hosting deployment
- Configure image optimization for domains

### 2. Firebase Configuration Updates

We updated `firebase.json` to:
- Point to the `.next` directory as the public directory
- Configure appropriate caching headers for assets
- Maintain the apphosting target configuration

### 3. API Route Fix

We fixed the `src/app/api/leaderboard-data/route.ts` route by:
- Correcting the variable reference from `res` to `csvResponse`
- Ensuring it works in both static and server-side modes

### 4. Deployment Scripts

We created specialized deployment scripts:
- `deploy-app-hosting-simple.sh`: Deploys specifically to App Hosting
- `check-hosting-status.sh`: Checks the status of all hosting targets

## Deployment Process

The new deployment process:

1. Builds the Next.js application in server-side mode
2. Points Firebase configuration to the `.next` directory
3. Deploys to the apphosting target
4. Automatically restores configurations after deployment

## GitHub Actions Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to:
1. Use Node.js 20.x
2. Set the correct environment variables for App Hosting
3. Deploy to the correct target

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployments**: Keep an eye on GitHub Actions deployment status
2. **Check Logs**: Use `firebase functions:log` to monitor server-side errors
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep deployment documentation updated with any changes

## Testing the Deployment

Run the following command to test the deployment status:

```bash
./check-hosting-status.sh
```

This will check all hosting targets and report their status.
