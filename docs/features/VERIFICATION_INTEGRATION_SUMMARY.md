  - TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Loading states and error handling  
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Firestore integration with `isVerified` and `setterVerified` fields
  - Proper disabled states and accessibility
  - Sync between `isVerified` and `setterVerified` fields for backward compatibility

### 2. Lead Management Spreadsheet Integration

- **Changes**:
  - Added VerifiedCheckbox import
  - Added "Verified" column to table header
  - Integrated VerifiedCheckbox component in table rows
  - Centered verification component in table cells

### 3. Main Lead Management Page Integration  
- **File**: `/src/app/dashboard/lead-management/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added VerifiedCheckbox import
  - Added "Verified" column to table header
  - Integrated VerifiedCheckbox component in table rows
  - Disabled verification during editing mode

### 4. Lead Card Component Integration
- **File**: `/src/components/dashboard/lead-card.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced old LeadVerificationButton with new VerifiedCheckbox
  - Updated imports
  - Simplified verification display in compact card layout

### 5. Type System Updates
- **File**: `/src/types/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `isVerified?: boolean` field to Lead interface
  - Maintains compatibility with existing `setterVerified` field

## ðŸ”„ EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY (Already Working)

### 45-Minute Rule Implementation
- **File**: `/src/components/dashboard/lead-queue.tsx`
- **Logic**: Only moves leads to waiting assignment if:
  - Lead is verified (`setterVerified === true`)
  - Within 45 minutes of appointment time
  - Proper appointment scheduling exists

### Lead Queue Processing
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring of scheduled leads
  - Automatic status transitions based on verification
  - 15-minute timeout for expired appointments
  - Toast notifications for status changes

## ðŸ§ª TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. UI Component Testing
- [ ] Verify VerifiedCheckbox renders in all lead management interfaces
- [ ] Test checkbox state persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Confirm disabled states work properly during editing
- [ ] Validate toast notifications appear correctly

### 2. Database Integration Testing
- [ ] Test `isVerified` field updates in Firestore
- [ ] Verify `setterVerified` field stays in sync
- [ ] Check `verifiedAt` timestamp accuracy
- [ ] Confirm real-time updates across multiple browser sessions

### 3. 45-Minute Rule Testing
- [ ] Create scheduled leads and verify they don't move to queue until verified
- [ ] Test leads within 45 minutes move to waiting assignment when verified
- [ ] Verify leads outside 45 minutes don't move even when verified
- [ ] Test expired lead cleanup (15 minutes past appointment)

### 4. Role-Based Access Testing
- [ ] Confirm setters can verify leads they created
- [ ] Test managers/admins can verify any team leads
- [ ] Verify closers can see verification status but not modify
- [ ] Check proper access control in all interfaces

## ðŸ“‹ MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST

### Lead Management Spreadsheet
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/lead-management-spreadsheet`
2. Verify "Verified" column appears in table
3. Click verification checkboxes and confirm state changes
4. Check toast notifications appear on verification changes
5. Refresh page and verify states persist

### Main Lead Management Page
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/lead-management`
2. Verify "Verified" column appears in table
3. Test verification while editing leads (should be disabled)
4. Test verification outside editing mode
5. Confirm CSV export includes verification status

### Lead Cards (Dashboard)
1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. View lead cards in "In Process Leads" section
3. Verify VerifiedCheckbox appears on lead cards
4. Test verification state changes
5. Check lead cards in other contexts (queues, etc.)

### Admin Tools Testing
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/admin-tools`
2. Test region creation/management
3. Test team creation within regions
4. Verify proper hierarchical structure
5. Test administrative functions

### Queue Processing Testing
1. Create a scheduled lead (use lead creation form)
2. Set appointment time within 45 minutes
3. Verify lead doesn't appear in waiting queue initially
4. Check the verification checkbox for the lead
5. Confirm lead moves to waiting assignment queue
6. Test with lead scheduled >45 minutes (should not move)

## ðŸš€ BROWSER CONSOLE TESTING

Use the test script: `/test-verification-workflow.js`

```javascript
// Copy and paste into browser console on dashboard
testVerificationWorkflow()
```

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS CRITERIA

### âœ… Integration Complete When:
1. VerifiedCheckbox appears in all lead management interfaces
2. Verification state persists across sessions
3. 45-minute rule enforces verification requirement
4. Real-time updates work across multiple browser sessions
5. Role-based access control functions properly
6. Toast notifications provide clear user feedback
7. No console errors or TypeScript compilation issues

### âš¡ Performance Verified When:
1. Checkbox state updates are immediate (<200ms)
2. Database writes complete successfully
3. Real-time listeners update other sessions quickly
4. No memory leaks in long-running sessions
5. Efficient Firestore queries (no unnecessary reads)

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS

1. **Manual Testing**: Execute the testing checklist above
2. **User Acceptance**: Have setters and managers test the workflow
3. **Load Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent users
4. **Documentation**: Update user guides with verification workflow
5. **Training**: Brief team on new verification requirements

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
- **Checkbox not appearing**: Check role-based access control
- **State not persisting**: Verify Firestore rules allow updates
- **45-minute rule not working**: Check lead has proper `scheduledAppointmentTime`
- **Real-time updates failing**: Confirm Firestore listeners are active

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firestore security rules
3. Test with different user roles
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Validate lead data structure in Firestore console
