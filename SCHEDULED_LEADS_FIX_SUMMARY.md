echo "ðŸ§ª Testing Scheduled Lead Validation Fix"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:"
echo "1. Added validation to form - scheduled dispatch requires date AND time"
echo "2. Made date/time fields required when scheduled dispatch is selected"
echo "3. Added user-friendly error message if date/time missing"
echo "4. Updated labels to show required fields with asterisks (*)"
echo "5. Removed debug logging from lead queue component"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ TESTING STEPS:"
echo "1. Open the Lead Queue and go to 'Create New Lead'"
echo "2. Select 'Scheduled Dispatch' - verify the scheduled section appears"
echo "3. Try to submit without filling date/time - should show error"
echo "4. Fill in all fields including date/time - should create successfully"
echo "5. Check the 'Scheduled' tab - the lead should appear there"
echo ""
echo "âœ… EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "- Form prevents submission when scheduled dispatch selected but no date/time"
echo "- Leads with scheduledAppointmentTime appear in scheduled queue"
echo "- Both 'scheduled' and 'rescheduled' statuses work in disposition modal"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE:"
echo "1. Enhanced form validation in create-lead-form-pure.tsx"
echo "2. Updated toggleScheduledSection to make fields required"
echo "3. Added visual indicators (*) for required fields"
echo "4. Added 'scheduled' status to disposition modal options"
echo ""
echo "âœ… Issue should now be RESOLVED!"
