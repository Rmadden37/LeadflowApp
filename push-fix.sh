- Move autoprefixer, postcss, and tailwindcss to main dependencies
- Firebase App Hosting requires build dependencies in main deps, not devDependencies
- Update apphosting.yaml with clearer documentation
- Add health check endpoints for deployment monitoring

This resolves the 'Cannot find module autoprefixer' error during Next.js build"
